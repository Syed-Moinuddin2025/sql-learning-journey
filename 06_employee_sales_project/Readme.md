# 👩‍💼 Employee Sales Performance Project

This project analyzes employee salary and sales performance using two main tables:

* `employees`
* `quarterly_sales`

The goal is to gain insights on sales trends, salary distribution, and departmental performance using SQL Server queries.

---

## 🗂️ Tables Used

* `employees` — Contains employee details such as `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `department`, and `salary`
* `quarterly_sales` — Contains quarterly sales per employee for Q1 to Q4 of 2022

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

* Basic `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, and `JOIN`
* Aggregation: `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`
* Filtering: salary thresholds, sales ranges
* Subqueries: compare with average salary/sales
* Table updates and schema changes using `UPDATE`, `ALTER`, and `sp_rename`

---

## 🔍 Sample Queries

* Total annual sales per employee
* Top and bottom sales performers
* Department-wise salary and employee count
