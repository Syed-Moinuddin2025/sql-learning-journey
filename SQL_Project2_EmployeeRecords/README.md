# 👨‍💼 Project 2: Employee Records Management

A structured SQL project simulating a real-world employee database for HR systems. Ideal for practicing **JOINs**, **aggregations**, **date functions**, and **salary computations**.

---

## 🏗️ Database Design Overview

This project includes **four normalized tables** with foreign key relationships:

- **Departments** – List of all departments  
- **Employees** – Basic employee information  
- **JobAssignments** – Tracks job titles with time validity  
- **Salaries** – Salary structure including allowances and deductions  

Entity Relationship:  
- One department has many employees  
- One employee can have one job title assignment  
- One employee has one salary record
