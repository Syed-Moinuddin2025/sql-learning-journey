# 📘 SQL Full Course for Beginners (# 📘 Learn SQL with Practical Projects)


Welcome to the **SQL Full Course for Beginners** repository! This project is designed to help you practice real SQL queries explained through YouTube tutorials. You’ll be working with a sample database named **MyDatabase**.
> ✅ **Built for learners who prefer structured, example-driven SQL practice!**

## 🎯 What's Inside?
This project includes:
- ✅ Table creation scripts
- ✅ Sample datasets
- ✅ SQL queries (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`)
- ✅ Jupyter Notebooks with query results
- ✅ Beginner to intermediate-level examples

---
## 🚀 Key Features

- 📂 Organized SQL practice files (step-by-step)
- 📒 Jupyter Notebooks with queries + results (interactive learning)
- 🗃️ Realistic `customers` and `orders` data for practice
- 💡 Progressive difficulty (Beginner → Intermediate)
---
## 🛠️ Database Name
**`MyDatabase`**

This is the working database where all exercises and examples will be executed.

## 🚀 How to Use

📥 Open the .sql files in Azure Data Studio, SQL Server Management Studio, or any preferred SQL client.

▶️ Run the .sql files in sequential order (from 01_create_table_customers.sql to the last one) to create tables, insert data, and practice queries.

🧪 Use the .ipynb Jupyter Notebook files to interactively view query results and learn visually.
